# Assignment 1 - Point3D Class and Strings
 
## Overview
For this task, you are required to create a function declaration within a class named `Point3D` and`Triangle` in the `Ex1/headers/Point3D.h`,
 `Ex1/headers/Triangle.h` files. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate the representation of a point within three-dimensional space.
 
## Implementation Steps
 
1. **Class File:**
   - Class Definition location: `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h`
   - Class Definition location: `/Ex1/headers/Triangle.h`
   - Implementation location: `/Ex1/src/Point3D.cpp`
   - Implementation location: `/Ex1/src/Triangle.cpp`
   - Implementation location: `/Ex1/src/Reader.cpp`
 
2. **Constructor:**
   - Write a constructor for `Point3D` that takes three double variables as arguments.
   - Write a constructor for `Triangle` that takes three objects of Point3D class as arguments.
   - Initializes member variables with the provided argument values.
 
3. **Getters:**
   - Add member functions (getters) to the class to display the member variables of the class.
   - Example: `x(),y(),z()` displays the x,y,z values of the `Point3D` object.
   - Example: `p1(),p2(),p3()` which return the objects of Point3D.
 
4. **Test Program File:**
   - Test Program: `/Ex1/src/Writer.cpp`
   - Test Program: `/Ex1/src/Reader.cpp`
